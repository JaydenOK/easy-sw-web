# ORM Introduction

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is metadata that describes the mapping between code control and database. Objects in an object-oriented language program are automatically associated with the corresponding database. Essentially, the number of database communication operations is transformed into another form of object that is convenient for understanding and convenient operations.
Each database table has a corresponding "model" that instantiates a new object with the model to interact with the table. You can query the data in the data table through the model and insert new records in the data table.
