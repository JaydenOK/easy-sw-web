# Proxy
Since Swoole Server does not support HTTP protocol, it is recommended to use EasySwoole as a backend service and add NGINX or APACHE as a proxy on the front end. Add forwarding rules by referring to the following example.


## Nginx
```
server {
    root /data/wwwroot/;
    server_name local.swoole.com;
    location / {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "keep-alive";
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        if (!-f $request_filename) {
             proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9501;
        }
    }
}
```

::: warning 
After the proxy, you can get the real ip of the client through `$request->getHeader('x-real-ip')[0]`
:::

## Apache
```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  Options +FollowSymlinks
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  #RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [QSA,PT,L]  fcgi下无效
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$  http://127.0.0.1:9501/$1 [QSA,P,L]
   #请开启 proxy_mod proxy_http_mod request_mod
</IfModule>
```
