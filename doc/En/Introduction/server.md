```

## Service start
Development model： 
```
php easyswoole start
```
## Daemon mode starts
```
php easyswoole start d
```
## Production environment (the default configuration is to load dev.php, use this command to load produce.php 3.1.2 before dev.env, produce.env)
```
php easyswoole start produce
```
## The service stops (the default configuration loads dev.php, using this command to load produce.php 3.1.2 before dev.env, produce.env)
```
php easyswoole stop produce
```

::: warning 
 Note that stop is required in the daemon mode, otherwise control+c or the terminal disconnects to exit the process.
:::

::: warning
 Note that after the command is added, other related stop, reload, and restart commands need to increase the produce parameter, otherwise it may be wrong.
:::

## Hot restart service
```
php easyswoole reload   (Hot restart)
```

::: warning
 Note that reload is required only in the daemon mode, otherwise control+c or the terminal disconnects to exit the process. Here is a hot restart, which can be used to update the file (business logic) that is loaded after the worker start, the main process (such as configuration File) will not be restarted. The http custom routing configuration will not be updated and needs to be restarted;
:::

## Restart service
```
php easyswoole restart (Force stop service and restart)
```

::: warning
`restart` is to force the service to stop and restart, so it is disabled in production mode, otherwise the process interruption may have unexpected loss.
:::


## File hot loading

Due to the characteristics of `swoole` resident memory, after modifying the file, you need to restart the worker process to reload the modified file into memory. We can customize the process to implement file change and automatically perform service overloading.
